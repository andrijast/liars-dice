In case you're unfamiliar with the game, here are brief rules of *Liar's Dice* to spare you from a google search.

> Each player has a set of dice known only to them. Players take turns in circle guessing on the number of dice that they believe are showing a given face between all sets of dice. The guesses keep rising (asserting higher quantities or values of the dice) until one player challenges the guess of the previous player's bid. After the challenge, eaither the bidder or challenger loses that round depending on whether challenge was successful. Loser removes one die from his set and the game continues with another round.
