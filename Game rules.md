In case you're unfamiliar with the game, here are brief rules of *Liar's Dice* to spare you from a google search.

> Game starts with all players having the same amount of dice in their hands. Each player rolls their set of dice without sharing what he got. Players take turns in circle guessing on the number of dice that they believe are showing a given face between all sets of dice among players. The guesses keep rising (asserting higher quantities or values of the dice) until one of the players challenges the last guess. If the challenge is successful, i.e. the guess was indeed wrong, bidder loses that round, while otherwise, challenger loses the round. Loser removes one die from his set and the game continues in next round with loser first to play. The only player left having at least one die wins the game.
